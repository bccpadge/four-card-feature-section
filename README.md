## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When building this project, I used CSS Grid to add space between the card title and description.

```css
.grid-sm {
  display: grid;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on modern CSS techinques in future projects. The clamp() function is concept that I am uncomfortable at moment and hopefully with practice I get better using it.
